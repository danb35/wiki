<p>This site started as a home for <a href="/fester/">Uncle Fester's Basic TrueNAS Guide</a>. &nbsp;Please note that I did not write this guide. It was written by user “<a href="https://www.truenas.com/community/members/unclefester.56907/">UncleFester</a>” from the TrueNAS forums. I've made a few edits and wiki-fied the guide, as well as updating the UI screenshots to reflect TrueNAS 13, but the bulk of it is his work, not mine.</p>
<p>Since then, I've added some more advanced information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/ssh-conversion">Converting a SmallStep TLS certificate authority to issue SSH certificates</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ssh-certs">Configuring servers for host and user SSH certificates</a></li>
  <li><a href="/imessage-bridge">Adding the iMessage bridge to a self-hosted Synapse server</a> (likely outdated)</li>
  <li><a href="/pve-replication">ZFS replication from Proxmox to TrueNAS</a></li>
  <li><a href="/manual-replacement">Manual disk replacement on TrueNAS SCALE</a></li>
  <li><a href="/pve-templates">VM Templates in Proxmox VE</a></li>
</ul>
