<p>In addition to your data that you want to access over the network, you need to provide disk space for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The TrueNAS operating system (16GB+)</li>
  <li>Applications</li>
  <li>Application data</li>
  <li>Virtual Machines</li>
</ul>
<p>The data in the above list that you need to be most concerned about are Virtual Machines as these may have very significant data volumes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Virtual Machine operating system</li>
  <li>Its data - which if you are going to the trouble of hosting an entire virtual machine is likely to be significantly larger than e.g. the data for normal TrueNAS apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, we believe that the remaining areas above are usually not going to be worth estimating because:</p>
<p>1. In our experience they are typically relatively small compared to the network accessible data (unless you plan to use something extraordinary as an application); and</p>
<p>2. The TrueNAS operating system is only supported when on a separate disk from other data</p>
<p>3. TrueNAS and applications would benefit from being on an SSD - and if you are having to buy a separate disk anyway, why not use a (relatively small by comparison to your main data) SSD to host the operating system.</p>
<p>We will come back to this requirement when we start to consider what hardware we are going to use to meet these requirements.</p>
