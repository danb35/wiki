<p>This section of the wiki will help you decide what server to buy.</p>
<p>We first cover some general topics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The absolute minimum hardware you can run TrueNAS on</li>
  <li>Some other general guidelines about more realistic minimum specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we look at the broad categories of server hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commercial NAS appliances - pre-built specialised NAS hardware from one of several commercial companies (including ixSystems, the people who bring you the free TrueNAS software)</li>
  <li>DIY NAS appliances - build-your-own NAS hardware, built by you from a range of cases (specialised NAS or standard tower) and motherboards specifically designed for NAS.</li>
  <li>General purpose servers - if your NAS requirements are larger than an appliance can provide, then a (rack-mounted) general purpose server may be what you need</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally we will cover how to match one of the above server types with the other hardware requirements, most importantly the number of SATA ports.&nbsp;</p>
