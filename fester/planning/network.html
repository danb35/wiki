<p>Whether your existing network is going to give you the performance you need / want is going to be highly dependent on the amount of data you are trying to send over it, so we can only give some general guidelines here.</p>
<p>Older network technology is pretty common in households who may not have upgraded their internet connection for some years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equally, it is quite likely that they started with a network that was standard technology at the time (say 100Mb ethernet and Wifi G or N) but have subsequently had an internet speed increase but (for example) still retained the existing wifi.</p>
<p>So, here are some simple guidelines to help you decide whether a network upgrade is needed and if so where and whatâ€¦</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>I would expect that most people have a mix of requirements across their home:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A normal place for using your PC(s) - say your lounge or home office - and you might need to download large files from the internet or from your NAS.</li>
  <li>One or more Smart TVs or streaming boxes in specific rooms, and you may have a 1080p or 4K or even 8K TV and you don't want the screen to freeze whilst it buffers or get pop-up messages (from e.g. Plex) saying that there isn't enough bandwidth to stream properly.</li>
  <li>Internet access from their mobile phone or tablet wherever they are in the house. If you are watching video on a large-screen tablet wherever you happen to be, you may need significant bandwidth, but generally speaking your mobile / tablet bandwidth requirements are going to be lower.</li>
  <li>You NAS may or may not need fast internet access, but if you are streaming media from it then it almost certainly will need fast LAN access.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Work out which areas of your home need fast access to the NAS or to the internet. For these areas (rooms) you will want (say) Gb ethernet / wifi AC, whereas (say) 100Mb ethernet / wifi N may be sufficient everywhere else.</li>
  <li>If your media streaming is 1080p or higher, you should probably be thinking of Gb ethernet / wifi AC for those rooms needing this.</li>
  <li>If your internet connection is (say) 60Mb or more, then you probably should be looking for Gb ethernet connection to the LAN from your router.</li>
  <li>If you need Gb ethernet anywhere, then you will need a Gb Ethernet switch. Your router may have a Gb Ethernet switch inside if it has sufficient ports for your needs, otherwise you may need to buy one.</li>
  <li>If you are having a Gb switch, then you almost certainly also want a Gb port on your NAS hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>These days, you should be able to see from hardware lights or from a web-GUI what speed each device on your network is achieving i.e<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>For wired connections, the connection between the switch and another device depends upon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The capabilities of the equipment at either end. If both are Gb capable, then in theory the link is Gb capable.</li>
  <li>The quality of the wiring. In theory you will need Cat-6 cabling for Gb ethernet, but in practice for the short distances you might have in your house, Cat-5 cables can still be fine, however in both cases the quality of how the RJ-45 plugs are fitted at either end (and the quality of the RJ-45 resistance to corrosion) can have a significant impact.</li>
  <li>If your e.g. Wifi Access Points are PoE, then you will probably want a PoE switch which will be a little more expensive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unmanaged Gb switches are not expensive. For example, at the time of writing in mid-2024, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PFYM5MZ">8-port unmanaged Netgear Gb switch can be &nbsp;bought in the USA for $20</a> or a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SCGFY3P">5-port unmanaged Tenda P-E Gb switch for c. $30</a>.</p>
