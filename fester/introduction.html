<p>The Introduction section of this Wiki sets the scene and gives a helicopter overview of the major sections of this guide.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gomez Addams is a family man, so he is going to guide you through building a home NAS server for your family or family business. Much of this might well be useful for a bigger business, but Gomez (who is the family businessman) has told Uncle Fester in no uncertain terms to stay away from big business IT because that is what professional IT people are for, and even Uncle Fester sometimes does as he is told.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that spirit and being brutally honest, this section is pretty much fluff and can be skipped without any real impact. But it does set the scene.</p>
