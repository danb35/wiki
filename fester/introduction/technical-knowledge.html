<p>Implementing TrueNAS definitely reduces the amount of technical knowledge you will need, but it doesn't eliminate it completely.</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS is a carefully pre-packaged version of Linux &amp; ZFS etc., avoiding the need for you to install each component yourself and then make them all work together, and avoid the huge mass of technical knowledge that this would require.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS comes with a pretty comprehensive UI, allowing you to do almost all of the set-up and day to day management of your NAS through the UI, without having to know the command line methods of configuring everything that you would otherwise need.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does <i><strong><u>NOT</u></strong></i> mean that you can design, install, set-up, manage on a day-to-day basis, and deal with any issues without any technical understanding, though you will certainly need less knowledge that you might otherwise do.</p>
<p>HexOS is purported to reduce the level of knowledge you need to setup and manage a TrueNAS installation, however the Addams family share a concern that if things go wrong you will then have even less technical knowledge and experience to draw upon to help fix things.</p>
<h2>So, what do you need to learn?</h2>
<p>This is a fairly opinionated list (and contributors should feel free to modify this list according to their own views):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic understanding of ZFS:<ul>
      <li>Mirrors vs. RAIDZ1/2/3</li>
      <li>Scrubs</li>
      <li>Snapshots (and Checkpoints)</li>
      <li>Asynchronous vs. synchronous writes</li>
      <li>When to use - or more often <strong>not to use</strong> - the various specialised performance enhancement “vDevs” that ZFS has</li>
      <li>What you should and shouldn't do (for fear of making things worse) if things do go wrong</li>
      <li>Resilvering</li>
      <li>RAIDZ expansion</li>
      <li>Replication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Basic understanding of SMART disk diagnostics</li>
  <li>Basic understanding of TCP/IP networking:<ul>
      <li>Initial setup</li>
      <li>For networking to containerised / virtualised applications</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Basic IT management concepts:<ul>
      <li>How safe is your data with ZFS?</li>
      <li>What constitutes a backup? Redundancy, snapshots, checkpoints, ZFS replication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
