<p>iXSystems has two current&nbsp;and distinct TrueNAS products each of which has several supported versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS CORE<ul>
      <li>Current version: 13.3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE<ul>
      <li>Current version: Fangtooth 25.04</li>
      <li>Previous version: Electric Eel 24.10</li>
      <li>Pre-release version: Goldeye 25.10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>TrueNAS CORE is built on top of FreeBSD and grew from FreeNAS, which dates back to about 2011. In addition to developing TrueNAS, iXSystems has contributed heavily to the development of FreeBSD and OpenZFS. Even Gomez, who has been around for a couple of centuries, and who has seen presidents and even countries come and go, is impressed with this pedigree. TrueNAS CORE is, however, now obsolescent at best; it remains supported, barely, from a security perspective (i.e. if security bugs are found they will be fixed) but aside from that development has ceased. If you are already using CORE, you really should be starting to think about moving at some point in the fairly-near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For basic NAS/ZFS operations, TrueNAS SCALE is essentially the same functionality but migrated to Debian Linux and saw its first release in early 2022. The change of technology base and ongoing development has resulted in some significant divergence between the two products at a very detailed level, but at a high level they have pretty similar NAS / ZFS functionality.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to running other software i.e. applications or virtualised operating systems under TrueNAS, CORE and SCALE differ significantly. CORE's applications functionality is primarily Jails (which are containerised FreeBSD images that share the same kernel and process scheduling with the base operating system. By comparison, SCALES applications support has been a bit of a moveable feast - up until Dragonfish it was Kubernetes based, however ElectricEel switched to a simpler Docker-based solution. The latest Fangtooth adds Linux Containers (LXCs, which are pretty like Jails) to the mix - so although there is no easy migration path from CORE Jails to SCALE LXCs (and certainly zero automated migration), Fangtooth will at least provide the infrastructure for reimplementing Jails as LXCs.</p>
<p>So, in SCALE your choices are now (or soon):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Docker containers (cut-down virtualised Linux, flexible allocation of memory and mapping of datasets)</li>
  <li>Fully virtualised operating systems (completely virtualised, fixed allocation of memory, only virtual disks or network access to datasets)</li>
  <li>(in Fangtooth) Linux Containers (more flexible virtualised Linux, flexible allocation of memory and mapping of datasets).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bottom Line (TL;DR)</h2>
<p>In general terms we currently recommend (as does iXSystems) that you install TrueNAS SCALE rather than CORE:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE has been the major focus of iXSystems' development efforts over the last four or more years, and that seems unlikely to change.&nbsp;All further improvements in functionality are going to be delivered in TrueNAS SCALE; CORE is in a â€œsustaining engineering phase" according to iXSystems (read: one foot in the grave).</li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE has had four major versions and a multitude of minor versions, and can be considered both stable, fully production quality and proven in the field.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS CORE 13.3 has now been released, and it's likely this will be the last release of CORE barring security fixes. &nbsp;Unless you have a philosophical or technical objection to Linux or preference for FreeBSD, you will want to install TrueNAS SCALE. If storage is your only need, CORE may still be a slightly better choice. If these do not apply or If you want to run applications or virtual machines, or position yourself for long-term upgrades, SCALE is almost certainly the best choice:</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose SCALE, then we recommend that you install the ElectricEel 24.10 version of TrueNAS SCALE rather than Dragonfish 24.04 or Fangtooth 25.04:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE Dragonfish&nbsp;24.04&nbsp;is still supported, but will soon be end-of-life and no longer supported by iXSystems - and installing this now will tie you to Kubernetes based applications that will need migration at a later date.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE&nbsp;ElectricEel&nbsp;24.10 has now had several minor releases to address bugs found after first release, is now fully recommended by iXsystems and can be considered full stable and will have support for a reasonable time.</li>
  <li>At the time of last edit (May 2025), TrueNAS SCALE&nbsp;Fangtooth&nbsp;25.04 is at its .0 release. &nbsp;Such releases from iX often are buggy (as they typically introduce new features that need to have bugs shaken out). &nbsp;At this writing, installing the latest 24.10 release may be the safer bet. &nbsp;But if you want to use LXCs, Fangtooth is the only option.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're reading this at a later date, our general recommendation is that you install the current release, once it's had a couple of point releases. &nbsp;Thus, if the current version is 25.04.0, you may want to install the latest release of 24.10 instead. &nbsp;But if the current version is 25.04.2, the major bugs have likely been worked out and it's probably safe to use.</p>
<h2>TrueNAS CORE v. SCALE</h2>
<p>TrueNAS CORE is different from SCALE in the following respects:</p>

          <p>SCALE Linux Containers: SCALE Fangtooth 25.04 will also provide Linux Containers which function similarly to the FreeBSD jails described above, however this is new functionality and some caution should still be exercised.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other alternatives</h2>
<p>In the interests of fairness - and because we are enthusiastic users rather than iXSystems employees - we would like to mention alternatives to TrueNAS and indicate (without being experts in these alternatives) how they differ from TrueNAS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://unraid.net/">unRAID</a> - Supports BTRFS, another file system similar to but different from ZFS. Supports mixed sized disks. &nbsp;Paid software only; there's no free version of unRAID. &nbsp;Loses points for using a .net TLD when they aren't an ISP.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">Open Media Vault</a> - Free, Linux-based NAS software. &nbsp;Can be made to support ZFS, but it doesn't appear to be well-integrated.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hexos.com/">Hex OS</a> - actually built on top of TrueNAS SCALE, this (as yet unreleased software) is intended to provide a simplified UI for both set-up and ongoing management in home / small business environments (however the authors of this Wiki do have some concerns that the functionality allowing reduced technical knowledge needed for set-up will NOT be matched by functionality reducing the technical knowledge needed if/when things go wrong).</li>
  <li><a href="https://xigmanas.com/">XigmaNAS</a> - Continues the original FreeNAS code base, FreeBSD-based.</li>
</ul>
