<p>iXSystems has two current&nbsp;and distinct TrueNAS products each of which has several supported versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS CORE<ul>
      <li>Current version: 13.3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE<ul>
      <li>Current version: Dragonfish 24.04</li>
      <li>Previous version: Cobia 23.10</li>
      <li>Pre-release version: Electric Eel 24.10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>TrueNAS CORE is built on top of FreeBSD and grew from FreeNAS, which dates back to about 2011. In addition to developing TrueNAS, iXSystems has contributed heavily to the development of FreeBSD and OpenZFS. Even Gomez, who has been around for a couple of centuries, and who has seen presidents and even countries come and go, is impressed with this pedigree.</p>
<p>TrueNAS SCALE is essentially the same functionality but migrated to Debian Linux and saw its first release in early 2022. The change of technology base and ongoing development has resulted in some significant divergence between the two products at a very detailed level, but at a high level they have pretty similar functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bottom Line (TL;DR)</h2>
<p>In general terms we currently recommend (as does iXSystems) that you install TrueNAS SCALE rather than CORE:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE has been the major focus of iXSystems' development efforts over the last four or more years, and that seems unlikely to change.&nbsp;Almost all further improvements in functionality are going to be delivered in TrueNAS SCALE rather than CORE.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE has had four major versions and a multitude of minor versions, and can be considered both stable, fully production quality and proven in the field.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS CORE 13.3 has now been released, and it's likely this will be the last release of CORE barring security fixes. &nbsp;Unless you have a philosophical or technical objection to Linux or preference for FreeBSD, you will want to install TrueNAS SCALE. If storage is your only need, CORE may still be a slightly better choice. If these do not apply or If you want to run applications or virtual machines, or position yourself for long-term upgrades, SCALE is almost certainly the best choice:</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose SCALE, then we recommend that you install the Dragonfish 24.04 version of TrueNAS SCALE rather than Cobia 23.10:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE Bluefin 22.12 is now end-of-life and no longer supported by iXSystems.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE Cobia 23.10 is still supported, but will soon be end-of-life and no longer supported by iXSystems.</li>
  <li>TrueNAS SCALE&nbsp;Dragonfish&nbsp;24.04 has had several minor releases to address bugs found after first release, is now fully recommended by iXsystems and can be considered full stable and will have support for a reasonable time.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're reading this at a later date, our general recommendation is that you install the current release, once it's had a couple of point releases. &nbsp;Thus, if the current version is 24.10.0, you may want to install the latest release of 24.04 instead. &nbsp;But if the current version is 24.10.2, the major bugs have likely been worked out and it's probably safe to install.</p>
<h2>Common Features</h2>
<p>Both SCALE and CORE support:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ZFS for managing storage</li>
  <li>File-sharing protocols of SMB and NFS, and block-storage protocol of iSCSI.</li>
  <li>Multiple users (with attendant security permissions), including integrating with LDAP or Active Directory environments.</li>
  <li>Running VMs and / or containerised apps</li>
</ul>
<h2>TrueNAS CORE v. SCALE</h2>
<p>TrueNAS CORE is different from SCALE in the following respects:</p>

      </tr>

        <td style="text-align:center;" colspan="2">File sharing</td>
        <td>CORE is marginally more mature and stable for basic file sharing functionality, but this gap is narrowing quickly.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jails</td>
        <td style="width:110px;">Apps<br><br>Linux Jails</td>
        <td>
          <p>CORE Jails: Light weight FreeBSD containers into which you can install pretty much any FreeBSD-compatible software you like.</p>
          <p>SCALE Apps: Kubernetes containers, with c. 100 provided by ixSystems and c. 800 more by TrueCharts.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>ixSystems has indicated that in ElectricEel they will drop Kubernetes in favour of a simpler Docker-based capability and have promised that TrueNAS Charts will have Docker equivalents.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>SCALE Jails: Dragonfish 24.04, SCALE also provides unofficial/unsupported support for “Linux jails,” which function similarly to the FreeBSD jails described above - however the CORE Jail Wizard UI&nbsp;is not provided but rather a community provided command line script can assist with setup.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other alternatives</h2>
<p>In the interests of fairness - and because we are enthusiastic users rather than iXsystems employees - we would like to mention alternatives to TrueNAS and indicate (without being experts in these alternatives) how they differ from TrueNAS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://unraid.net/">unRAID</a> - Supports BTRFS, another file system similar to but different from ZFS. Supports mixed sized disks. &nbsp;Paid software only; there's no free version of unRAID. &nbsp;Loses points for using a .net TLD when they aren't an ISP.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openmediavault.org/">Open Media Vault</a> - Free, Linux-based NAS software. &nbsp;Can be made to support ZFS, but it doesn't appear to be well-integrated.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hexos.com/">Hex OS</a> - actually built on top of TrueNAS SCALE, this (as yet unreleased software) is intended to provide a simplified UI for both set-up and ongoing management in home / small business environments.</li>
  <li><a href="https://xigmanas.com/">XigmaNAS</a> - Continues the original FreeNAS code base, FreeBSD-based.</li>
</ul>
