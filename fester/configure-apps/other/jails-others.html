<h1>Other Jails</h1>
<p>A jail is simply a FreeBSD environment, so you can install pretty much any software that will run under FreeBSD in a jail, following the same methods you'd use under ordinary FreeBSD (often this would start with <code>pkg install packagename</code>, followed by some configuration steps).</p>
<p>Users who are less technically-minded may be tempted to use plugins instead. &nbsp;<strong>Please don't do this.</strong> &nbsp;Plugins have always been poorly maintained, are now all but deprecated, and are scheduled to be removed from TrueNAS CORE entirely in the near future. &nbsp;If you want a plugin-like experience, where you can point and click to install the software you want, you should consider using TrueNAS SCALE rather than TrueNAS CORE. &nbsp;SCALE has a much larger and more up-to-date app catalog.</p>
<p>Somewhat of a “middle path” is the use of scripts to create jails with particular software. &nbsp;This was described in the page for <a href="/fester/jails-plex">Plex Media Server</a>, and there are several other such scripts available, including:</p>
