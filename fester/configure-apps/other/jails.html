<h1>Jails</h1>
<p>I decided to create a separate section for Jails. I did this so others can easily add their plugin guides after this one. In this way a repository of different plugins can be accumulated over time.</p>
<p>The user of this guide can then choose the one they need for the plugin of their choice.</p>
<p>Jails basically allow the TrueNAS OS to be customised in particular ways to provide extra functionality and offer additional services that did not come with the standard TrueNAS OS.</p>
<p>Jails also provide another very important function in addition to this. If any program running in a Jail hangs, crashes or falls over (like Fester when he has had one sherbet too many) the Jail acts as a bulwark so the TrueNAS OS and other Jails do not also crash.</p>
<p>Jails also supply a totally independent network stack which can be very useful and ensures a certain amount of resilience when things go wrong.</p>
<p>Before we get to the specifics of configuring a particular plugin we first must set the conditions within which all the Jails will operate.</p>
