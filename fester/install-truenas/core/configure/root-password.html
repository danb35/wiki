<h1>Changing the "root" Super User Password</h1>
<p>During installation, you had the ability to set a root password. If you entered a strong password at that time, you do not need to reset it now. If you entered no password, or a weak password, you should change it to a secure password. To do this, open your web browser and type in the IP address of the TrueNAS web GUI that you noted down earlier.</p>
<p>The web GUI will present itself and ask for the login details. Enter the username which is <strong>root</strong> (1) and password (2) which is whatever you decided on at installation and click the “Log In” button (3).</p>

<p>Now you are logged into TrueNAS.</p>
<p>The first thing Fester does is give the root user a strong password if that has not been done already at installation. Click <strong>Accounts</strong> in the left column, then <strong>Users</strong></p>

<p>Then click the three vertical dots to the right of the root user, and select <strong>Edit</strong> from the pop-up menu:</p>

<p>In the “Password:” text box (1) type in your strong password and then type it in again in the “Confirm password” text box (2).</p>

<p>The maximum password length in TrueNAS is 128 characters.</p>
<p>Now scroll down and click the “Save” button.</p>

<p>That’s the root user password changed.</p>
