<h1>NTP Server Configuration</h1>
<p>An NTP server (Network Time Protocol) is a server that basically communicates with the computers on your network to keep their clocks synchronised together.</p>
<p>TrueNAS defaults to NTP servers that are managed by the FreeBSD foundation, and in most cases these will be perfectly fine. &nbsp;However, you may have a reason to want to change this setting. &nbsp;So if you want to do this on your TrueNAS server, this is how.</p>
<p>First make sure that the TrueNAS server has been given the information it needs to find your ISPs DNS servers. This is done in the “Network → Global Configuration” page in the “Nameserver 1 – 3:” text boxes. If this has not been done then a URL (i.e. a webpage address) cannot be resolved to an IP address. In other words the server will not be able to find the resource it is looking for on the internet.</p>
<p>Now find a public NTP website for your country that provides the URLs for their NTP servers. Without those URLs your server will not find the resource and receive the synchronisation information.</p>
<p>I am based in the UK (Fester is British, a fact that has stupefied and shamed the British Nation for many years now) so I use <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/uk"><strong>http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/uk</strong></a> for my TrueNAS server.</p>
<p>The URLs look like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">0.uk.pool.ntp.org</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">1.uk.pool.ntp.org</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">2.uk.pool.ntp.org</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">3.uk.pool.ntp.org</p>
<p>When you have this information go to the “System” page (1) and click on the “General” button (2).</p>
<p>This will bring up the page where the settings for the NTP servers reside.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/ntp1.png"></figure>
<p>First delete all the default entries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the three dots to the right of the entry you want to delete (1).</p>
<p>Now click on the “Delete” button (2).</p>
<p>Repeat this for any further entries you need to delete.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/ntp2.png"></figure>
<p>Now click on the “Add” button and a new window should pop up.</p>
<p>Enter the address of the NTP server in the “Address:” text box (1).</p>
<p>Leave every other setting at its default value.</p>
<p>Now click on the “SUBMIT” button (2).</p>
<p>Repeat this process for any other NTP servers you wish to add.</p>

<p>That’s the NTP servers configured.</p>
