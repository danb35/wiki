<h1>SMART Test Schedule</h1>
<p>There are two types of SMART test that require schedules. We need to create a Long SMART test schedule and a Short SMART test schedule.</p>
<h2>Long SMART Test Schedule</h2>
<p>Click on “Tasks” in the left column, then “S.M.A.R.T. Tests”.</p>

<p>Now click on “Add” button.</p>
<p>A screen will pop up.</p>

<p>Select the storage drives you want to test from the “Disks” drop-down. Click individually on each disk you want to test.</p>

<p>Select the type of SMART test you want (in this case it is “Long Self-Test”) from the “Type” drop down selection box.</p>
<p>Give the test a name, if desired, in the “Short description” text box.</p>
<p>Fester wants to schedule these tests to run on the 8<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> of every month at 02:00 in the morning (the server should not be busy at that time). To do this, under “Schedule the S.M.A.R.T. Test”, select “Custom”. This will open a scheduling window.</p>

<p>Under Hours/Days, in Hours, enter <strong>2</strong>. In Days, enter <strong>8,22</strong>. You'll see that the calendar on the left updates to indicate the dates tests will run. Click “Done” to close the scheduler, and “Save” to save this self-test schedule.</p>
<p>That’s the long test schedule set.</p>
<h2>Short SMART Test Schedule</h2>
<p>Click on “Tasks” in the left column, then “S.M.A.R.T. Tests”.</p>

<p>Give the test a name, if desired, in the “Short description” text box.</p>
<p>Fester wants to schedule these tests to run on the 5<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> of every month at 03:00 in the morning (the server should not be busy at that time). To do this, under “Schedule the S.M.A.R.T. Test”, select “Custom”. This will open a scheduling window.</p>

<p>Under Hours/Days, in Hours, enter <strong>3</strong>. In Days, enter <strong>5,12,19,26</strong>. You'll see that the calendar on the left updates to indicate the dates tests will run. Click “Done” to close the scheduler, and “Save” to save this self-test schedule.</p>
<p>That’s the short test schedule set.</p>
