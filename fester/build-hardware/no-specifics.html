<p>Well, or two reasons really…</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every model of hardware is different, so at best you can only give one or two examples</li>
  <li>I (Uncle Fester) had no idea at the time I built my server that I would end up writing a TrueNAS guide. So naturally I did not take any pictures (this is known as a Fester f@%k-up).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if there is someone out there who is building a server and would like to provide detailed, copyright free pictures (stage by stage, no missing bits out because it’s a beginners guide) then let me have them, I would love to include them in this guide.</p>
<p>You can also become a contributor. Why not replace this section with your own?</p>
