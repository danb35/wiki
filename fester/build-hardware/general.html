<ul>
  <li>Be careful of electric shock. Disconnect the power before working on a computer. NEVER dismantle a PSU, there are lethal voltages and currents inside and you can still get a shock off them even when they are disconnected from mains power. Computer parts are replaceable, you are not.</li>
  <li>Be careful of the sharp edges of the computer case/chassis. This tends not to be so much of a problem these days as contemporary computer cases tend to be made better now.</li>
  <li>Disconnect the power before connecting or disconnecting cables or components. If power is still going to the motherboard while you are carrying out these activities you might damage the electronics.</li>
  <li>Always use an antistatic wrist band when handling the components.</li>
  <li>Don’t build your server on a surface that is or could become heavily electrostatically charged (e.g. carpets, etc).</li>
  <li>Certain types of clothing are more prone to electrostatic build-up than others (in the past Fester built all his computers in a gorgeous diaphanous negligee, but was building up too much charge. I now wear nothing more than a cheeky smile and the thong).</li>
  <li>Don’t grab the contacts when handling components. Even the cleanest hands have a thin film of grease on them which you will transfer to the copper contacts.</li>
  <li>Good cable management will slightly improve air flow around your components. Take some time on this and do a little planning (I tend to get the power cables in first and then the data cables).</li>
  <li>Have a good supply of cable ties, these will help you with cable management.</li>
</ul>
<p>(If anyone can think of anything else that should go in this section let me know and if it’s reasonable and I have time, I will add it.)</p>
